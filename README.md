# Nine Lives - LD41
This is a game entry to [Ludum Dare 41](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41).
The goal was to make a game in 48 hours based off of the theme, "combine 2 incompatible genres".

## Storyline
You are a tuxedo cat living in your human's mouse-infested home.
Luckily for you, your human allows you to eat the mice (what else do you expect?).
So because of that, you do what a feline does best: you pounce and devour each and every last one of them.

## How to play
Catch as many mice as you can before you lose your nine lives.
On all devices, click the mice to catch them and get points.
On iOS, you can also play "Tilt Mode" and move the cat to the mice by tilting your phone.

## Inspiration
The idea came to my mind within seconds: cats and mice are incompatible.
The reason I kept this idea was because I have two cats myself, and they mean so much to me.
